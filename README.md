# What is the FORGE? (ex HikkaHq)
Forge is the project that started as anonymous web-chat, under the HikkaHQ title, inspired by an anime "Durarara!!".

# Key features
- Anonymous communication
The FORGE doesn't require you to share your personal details, like real name, email, phone number, etc.
- Open Content
Most of our content remain public - unregistered user can see and participate in most Threads, Comments, Chat rooms
and will be signed with randomly assigned name, such as "wise-ram".
- Exclusivity 
Some users can receive referral keys from registered users, which will allow them to register and use their own 
username and access wider variety of content. Additionally, every registered user will receive random amount of referral
keys upon registration.
- Board
Users can create threads in the Board section of the site, comment on them, share pictures, discuss their interests
and share their own content. Threads act just like any other Post on social media, but on the FORGE, they have their own 
place to live. Some Threads will be pinned to their categories, which most likely will contain brief description of the
category and it's rules. If any unpinned thread reaches the age of 1 month, it will be locked and sent
to the *Archive*.
- Chat
Semi-private chat rooms, separated by the Categories and Names. Users are allowed to create their own chat rooms, 
which will remain active as long as the room has at least 1 user demonstrating activity. Additionally, every category 
of the Board has it's own chat room, which do not require users to stay in those rooms.

# How to run?
Users can run their own instances of the FORGE, this functionality will be added in future commits.
To run the project, download the sources from this repository and run 'python3 manage.py runserver'.

# Disclaimer
- Open source data
    Although the FORGE doesn't require your personal details, all data such as Threads, Comments and Messages in 
    the Chat, should **NOT** be treated as private/personal data, as the maintainer holds the rights to 
    manipulate that data at their will.
- Data safety
    It is something that we do **NOT** guarantee.
